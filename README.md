how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20 / 20

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
Compared to other content introduced so far, this weeks is a bit harder to understand. I watched all the videos and followed the lab closely, but I felt as though the instructions could have been clearer in their explanation of why we are doing certain things. I enjoy that code was added for us, so we didn't necessarily have to do anything except put it in the right places.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took me around 2 to 3 hours to finish this, mostly because I watched all the videoes several times trying to do the lab myself before realizing that you provided code for us to utilize. 

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The bootstrap 'display-4' class alters the 'display' property of an element, which controls it's rendering box type. The 'display-4' class is part of a series of classes designed to make heading elements larger and slightly more opinionated.
